'''
What is Polymorphism?
    .polymorphism is the condition of occurrence in different forms.
    It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator or object) to represent
    different types in different scenarios.
    polymorphism means the same function name being used for different types.

    Example:'''
def add(x, y, z = 0):
    return x + y+z

# Driver code
print(add(2, 3))
print(add(2, 3, 4))


#Polymorphism with class methods:

#Example:

class India():
    def capital(self):
        print("New Delhi is the capital of India.")

    def language(self):
        print("Hindi is the most widely spoken language of India.")

    def type(self):
        print("India is a developing country.")


class USA():
    def capital(self):
        print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.")

    def language(self):
        print("English is the primary language of USA.")

    def type(self):
        print("USA is a developed country.")


obj_ind = India()
obj_usa = USA()
for country in (obj_ind, obj_usa):
    country.capital()
    country.language()
    country.type()

#Polymorphism with Inheritance:
#Example:


class Bird:
    def intro(self):
        print("There are many types of birds.")

    def flight(self):
        print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")


class sparrow(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        print("Sparrows can fly.")


class ostrich(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        print("Ostriches cannot fly.")


obj_bird = Bird()
obj_spr = sparrow()
obj_ost = ostrich()

obj_bird.intro()
obj_bird.flight()

obj_spr.intro()
obj_spr.flight()

obj_ost.intro()
obj_ost.flight()

#Polymorphism with a objects:
#Example:


def func(obj):
    obj.capital()
    obj.language()
    obj.type()


obj_ind = India()
obj_usa = USA()

func(obj_ind)
func(obj_usa)

#Function polymorphism
#Example:
class India():
    def capital(self):
        print("New Delhi is the capital of India.")

    def language(self):
        print("Hindi is the most widely spoken language of India.")

    def type(self):
        print("India is a developing country.")


class USA():
    def capital(self):
        print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.")

    def language(self):
        print("English is the primary language of USA.")

    def type(self):
        print("USA is a developed country.")


def func(obj):
    obj.capital()
    obj.language()
    obj.type()


obj_ind = India()
obj_usa = USA()

func(obj_ind)
func(obj_usa)
